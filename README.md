# Ardiuno Wordclock Project

This is my attempt on building a [Wordclock], using an Arduino Nano, a
multiplexed 10x10 grid of white LEDs and two SN74HC595 shift registers for each
dimension (so four in total). Additionally, two switches to set the clock are
needed.

I roughly followed [this blog post by tns-labs], except I didn't etch
the board but soldered. Any other guide should do as well, obviously. As of
yet, I'm still missing the front layer containing the lettersâ€¦
